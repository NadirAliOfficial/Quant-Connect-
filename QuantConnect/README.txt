This algorithm short-sells a strangle based on a custom indicator value in QuantConnect. The custom indicator is loaded from a CSV file. The algorithm checks the indicator value daily. If the indicator value is greater than 90, the algorithm short-sells a strangle for SPY with expiration dates between 30-45 days and 45-60 days from the current date.

Prerequisites:
Install QuantConnect: pip install quantconnect
Prepare a rank_indicator.csv file with date and Close columns.
Usage:
Save the provided code in a Python file, e.g., rank_based_strangle.py.
Run the algorithm: qc run rank_based_strangle.py
Algorithm Description
Custom Indicator: RankIndicator reads data from rank_indicator.csv and stores the Close column.

Main Algorithm: RankBasedStrangleAlgorithm sets the symbol, schedules a daily check for the custom indicator, and short-sells a strangle if the custom indicator value is greater than 90.

Considerations:
Provide the rank_indicator.csv file.
Backtest with historical data.
Use a live trading account.
Monitor the algorithm regularly.
