# Rank-Based Strangle Algorithm

## Overview
This algorithm implements a rank-based strangle trading strategy using data obtained from Quandl. It ranks the given dataset and takes trading actions based on the ranking criteria. Specifically, it sells strangle options when the rank exceeds a certain threshold.

## Requirements
- QuantConnect account
- Access to Quandl data
- Basic knowledge of algorithmic trading and Python programming

## Getting Started
1. **Quandl Account**: Sign up for a Quandl account if you haven't already. Ensure you have access to the dataset you intend to use.

2. **Quandl Code**: Obtain the Quandl code for your desired dataset. This code will be used to fetch data from Quandl. 

3. **QuantConnect**: Log in to your QuantConnect account and create a new project.

4. **Algorithm Code**: Copy the provided algorithm code into your QuantConnect project. Replace `'YOUR_QUANDL_CODE'` with the actual Quandl code you obtained.

5. **Backtesting**: Backtest the algorithm to ensure it performs as expected. Adjust parameters as needed.

6. **Live Trading**: Once satisfied with the backtest results, deploy the algorithm for live trading on QuantConnect.

## Important Notes
- Ensure that you have proper access rights and permissions to use the Quandl dataset in your algorithm.
- Test the algorithm thoroughly in backtesting before deploying it for live trading.
- Monitor the algorithm's performance regularly and make adjustments as necessary.

## Disclaimer
This algorithm is provided for educational and informational purposes only. Algorithmic trading involves risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Use the algorithm at your own risk.
